hpm?

I guess to clarify my concern: what does "Kernel" refer to here?

The devicetree describes the hardware, so references to things such as
"driver" and "kernel" tend to be a little suspicious.

For reference, here's a sample of other model names that have been
used:

   > git grep model arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/ | shuf | head
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-facebook-harma.dts: model =3D "Faceb=
ook Harma";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-asrock-e3c256d4i.dts:       model =
=3D "ASRock E3C256D4I BMC";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-facebook-minipack.dts:      model =
=3D "Facebook Minipack 100 BMC";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-facebook-santabarbara.dts:  model =
=3D "Facebook Santabarbara BMC";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-facebook-elbert.dts:        model =
=3D "Facebook Elbert BMC";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-facebook-greatlakes.dts:    model =
=3D "Facebook Greatlakes BMC";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-ibm-fuji.dts:       model =3D "Fuji"=
;
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-facebook-cmm.dts:   model =3D "Faceb=
ook Backpack CMM BMC";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-ibm-balcones.dts:   model =3D "Balco=
nes";
   arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed/aspeed-bmc-vegman-rx20.dts:    model =3D "YADRO=
 VEGMAN Rx20 BMC";

These don't tend to reference either the SoC or the kernel, rather the
platform that the SoC sits in. "MSX4" might be enough?

No dramas, however, I'd appreciate a comment in the devicetree along
these lines.
