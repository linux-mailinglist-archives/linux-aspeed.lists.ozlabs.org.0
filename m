I have to manage that in tension with my concern of people simply not
upstreaming their devicetrees in response. I'd prefer to have them
merged upstream than to encourage more forks in this corner of the
world. If people would like to take the initiative and do the binding
conversions, corrections and devicetree fixes themselves, I'll
definitely review them.

I think where things stand currently is a bit fuzzier than anyone would
like. The nodes are not incorrect to the point of being non-functional
with respect to their intent, but clearly they're not so correct that
they do not have room for improvement.
